Description of Included Files:

lab3b.py
    This is the python source file that audits file system reports given in
    csv format. This program is made to run with Python 3, seeing as Python 2
    has been deprecated. The program takes in one mandatory argument, which is 
    the file to be audited.

    The usage is as follows:
        python3 lab3b.py fs_audit_report

lab3b.sh
    This shell script is used to run the python script. The Makefile will
    create a link to this script in its default target. This functionality is
    included solely for the grading script.

Makefile
    The Makefile for this project supports three targets:

    (default): Creates a link to lab3b.sh named lab3b for the grading script
    clean: Removes all files created by the Makefile
    dist: Builds the submission tarball

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing Methodology:

Testing with the provided trivial.csv file
    The script behaves as expected on an unmodified trivial.csv file. For
    different parts of the assignment, the trivial.csv file was modified to 
    test if the script outputs the correct lines.

Sanity Check:
    This program passes the provided sanity check.
