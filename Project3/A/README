Testing Methodology

Testing with the provided EXT2_test.img
    We looked out for any abnormal values and edge cases. Cases such as non-
    ASCII file names, non-valid blocks, and unallocated areas does not seem to
    make the program crash.

Sanity Check
    This program passes the provided sanity check.
