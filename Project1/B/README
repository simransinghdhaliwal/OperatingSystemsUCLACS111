METHOD: In order to complete this lab, I first learned about the APIs and I looked for many examples on how they are used.
Secondly, I knew many things would have to same the same from lab1a; therefore, I tried to make very few changes from what I 
did lab1a.

(NOTE: Some of the sources I cite are the same as I cited for lab1a.)
